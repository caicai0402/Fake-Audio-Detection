## Usage
Please see run.sh as the main entry.

This recipe provides a tiny dataset that is part of the Training, Development, and Adaptation set, for sanity testing. If you want the complete dataset, please contact the organizer of the ADD challenge (registration@addchallenge.cn).

The noise and impulse response dataset can be download from open resources:
* the MUSAN dataset: https://www.openslr.org/17/
* the simulated RIR dataset: https://www.openslr.org/26/
